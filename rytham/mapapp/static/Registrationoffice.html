          The "new Vellore registration office" likely refers to either the Sub-Registrar Office (SRO) for property and document registration or the Regional Transport Office (RTO) for vehicle-related services. The SRO handles property documents, marriage registrations, and other vital records, while the RTO manages driving licenses, vehicle registration, and fitness certificates. Both are crucial government offices, with the SRO located at Veppamara Street and the RTO serving all vehicle-related needs under the codes TN23 and TN83.
